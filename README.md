# ensf480 REPO IS DEAD, USE BOOKS

Aight so I've already got a books repo, with all these books and a bunch more
(everything for 3rd year sengg and other shit) so look there I'll archive this 
repo and eventually take it off hub.

You can find the books repo right [here](https://github.com/BeauSLM/books)

p.s. if you get the termite meme, you're a homie
